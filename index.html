                <h2 class="blurb">This Young Fellow is Robert.</h2>
                <p class="blurb">Born on the 30th of June in the year 1992 this good looking chum has lived his life believing he is the protagonist of his own story. With many lofty goals and ambitions
                    his many pursuits of interest can end up getting in the way of each other and not much gets done. But he does work hard for things he's interested in and learns new skills quite quickly.
                    Although a perfectionist who enjoys taking his time to really learn new tasks and hobbies he has a keen eye for detail, works fairly well under pressure and has a real knack for building and fixing things.
                    Always saying things such as "give me enough time and I can fix anything! Except people or relationships."

                <h3>Hobbies</h3>
                <p>His hobbies include learning new things, coding (though he barely knows anything), art, music, learning Japanese, making videos, fixing things, and working out.
                   There are many more interests that we could discuss but let's not bore you with smaller details

                <h3>Experience</h3>
                <h4>Work</h4>
                    <p>Our lad Robert has had a few experiences with working in his one quarter century of life starting at the age of 13 selling
                         wheat heating bags and other delightful goods at a farmers market. <br />
                        We can't forget the typical jobs to be had in one's teenage years; Mcdonald's, Tim Horton's, a couple janitorial jobs, 
                        and general labour in a fire&safety equipment shop.<br />
                        After finishing his schooling he moved onto doing odd jobs through the Labour Ready until finally landing a permanent job with National Oilwell Varco. 
                        There he spent 4 years as an apprentice Heavy Equipment Technician making it to his third year before regrettably being laid off. 
                        At NOV he spent his time assembling and testing hydraulic and mechanical systems; including Pipecat HPUs and Drawworks brake systems, made hydraulic
                         hoses on a few occasions, 
                        replaced all the hoses for a an old Mammoet trailer, and did the morning inspections on three of the overhead cranes. <br />
                        After the layoffs it took quite some time for Robert to find another job that could pay his mortgage but he eventually got hired at his 
                        current job working in the Screen Plant of Baker Hughes. Here he assembles and installs flow restrictors and screens on drill pipe. They also taught 
                        him how to skim parts using a manual lathe!
